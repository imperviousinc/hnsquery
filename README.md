# Handshake Query

⚠️ Usage of this library is not currently recommended in your application as the API will likely change.

Handshake Query is a cross-platform library to trustlessly resolve and verify Handshake names using an SPV node. Supports DNSSEC & DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE). It wraps [libhsk](https://github.com/handshake-org/hnsd) with a thread-safe API. It's currently being used by Impervious browser.
## Supported Platforms

iOS, Android, macOS, Windows and Linux

## Usage

### Launching an SPV node

This example shows how to launch an SPV node, wait for it to sync and store block headers in a temp directory.

```go
package main

import (
	hns "github.com/imperviousinc/hnsquery"
)

config := &hns.Config {
    // Used for storing cache data such as block headers 
    DataDir: os.TempDir(),
}


client, err := hns.NewClient(config)
if err != nil { ... }
defer client.Destroy()

ready := make(chan error)
client.Start(ready)

<-ready // blocks until SPV node is synced

// Get proofofconcept zone
zone, err := client.GetZone("proofofconcept")
for _, rr := range zone {
   fmt.Println(rr)
}

// Read info
fmt.Println("Height: ", client.Height())
fmt.Println("Sync progress: ", client.Progress())
fmt.Println("Peers: ", client.PeerCount())
fmt.Println("Active Peers:", client.ActivePeerCount())
```

### Resolving names

```go
// create a Proof of work trust anchor using the client
powTA := func(ctx context.Context, cut string) (*dnssec.Zone, bool, error) {
	// Follow example in mobile package
}

// initialize a resolver in forwarding mode with DoH
resolver, err := hns.NewResolver(&ResolverConfig{
        TrustAnchorFunc: powTA,
	Forward: "https://hs.dnssec.dev/dns-query"
})

// Securely resolve names with trustless DNSSEC validation
resolver.Query("_443._tcp.proofofconcept.", dns.TypeTLSA)

```


### Verifying certificates
You can create custom cert verifiers but in most cases you may want to use the default:
```go
cv := hns.NewDNSCertVerifier(resolver)
cv.Verify(ctx, &CertVerifyInfo{
    Host: "proofofconcept",
    Port: "443",
    Protocol: "tcp",
    RawCerts: certs
})
```

## DNSSEC validation

Handshake Query provides a modern Handshake native DNSSEC validation package that doesn't rely on a root KSK. Although this is optional as it can be integrated with other libraries such as libunbound to support a recursive mode (TODO)

[RFC8624](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8624) still considers weak crypto such as 256-bit RSA key size to be secure. The web has moved on. hnsq will downgrade algorithms it considers weak and they cannot be used for DANE. The following table shows which algorithms are accepted: 
```
+--------+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| Number | Mnemonics          | Supported for DANE               |
+--------+--------------------+ ---------------------------------+

| 3      | DSA                | NO                               |
| 5      | RSASHA1            | NO                               |
| 6      | DSA-NSEC3-SHA1     | NO                               |
| 7      | RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 | NO                               |
| 8      | RSASHA256          | YES - Min key size 2048 bit      |
| 10     | RSASHA512          | YES - Min key size 2048 bit      |
| 12     | ECC-GOST           | NO                               |
| 13     | ECDSAP256SHA256    | YES                              |
| 14     | ECDSAP384SHA384    | YES                              |
| 15     | ED25519            | YES                              |
| 16     | ED448              | TODO                             |

### PoWDoH

PoWDoH (PoW over DoH) is a technique for requesting the DNSSEC chain from a DoH server and verifying it with proof of work. This is done by fetching a verified DS record from an SPV node. DNS records & DNSSEC signatures can be transmitted over any channel. DoH transmits the signatures over HTTPS. 

There are some advantages to using a DoH server compared to doing recursion starting from the Handshake root zone. First, plain DNS traffic is unreliable on some networks due to middlebox interference. Using DoH, DNS queries can hide with other HTTPS traffic, while port 53 is easy to block and censor by ISPs. Also, it may not be possible to run a full recursive resolver on some mobile devices, especially along with an SPV node. On iOS, network extensions are limited to 15MB of memory. SPV node alone needs 40MB+, so enabling device-wide handshake recursive resolver on iOS is impossible at the moment, but this may change in the future.

Using a forwarding resolver is also faster than recursion since it benefits from a global cache and uses less resources. Currently, this library queries DNS records over DoH. It re-uses TCP connections to reduce latency, but performance can be improved with CHAIN queries (RFC7901) or by implementing RFC9102 to avoid querying for DNSSEC chain completely.

### TLS DNSSEC Chain Extension (RFC9102)

The DNSSEC chain extension is an experimental TLS extension that embeds the DNSSEC chain which obviates the need to perform separate, out-of-band DNS lookups. The complete chain can be validated directly with an SPV node. No need for an external forwarding or recursive resolver.

Not currently supported by either clients or servers.

## Build

Note: these instructions are not yet complete but you should be able to build it if you're familar with cgo.

### iOS

$ gomobile bind -target ios/arm64 -o MobileHNS.xcframework github.com/imperviousinc/hnsquery/mobile
```

### Android

You can build it with gomobile. You also need NDK to compile libhsk.
